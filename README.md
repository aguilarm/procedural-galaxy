# Procedural

This is a collection of small experiments with procedural generation in JS.

To start, I'm loosely following [this video from javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZY9YE7rZJw) which
creates an elite-style galaxy map procedurally in C++.

## Running

This is running on `remix.run`, which is similar to NextJS. You can use `yarn dev`, `yarn start`, and a few other commands to get going. Check `package.json` for the available commands, and [the remix.run docs](https://remix.run) for loads more info.
